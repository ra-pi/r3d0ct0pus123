            DS Farm Canada is a company founded in 2018 that engaged in milk processing and milk production to the market. In year 2021, The staff, administrators and employees made a proposal to establish a company-based training in the City of General Santos.
            The CEO and Proprietor, Mr. Bayliss Kurt J. Razo together with his wife Theresa Jabez Aspe as the COO / Company Nurse were inspired to start this company-based training because they were passionate in farm animals especially cows and was eager to share with the local farmers and aims to teach trainees with quality working experience in farm animal welfare, milk production, farm management and other related agricultural skills by following the standards for competency-based training and assessment program.
            Moreover, they were actively engaging in community outreach programs through its partnership with Deparment of Education (DepEd) and the Barangay by providing the students with milk. These outreach programs paved its way for Mr. Razo to be closer to the children and whenever he comes they are chanting his name which later on made him known as "Boy Gatas".
            In the future, Dairysquare Agri Trading will be recognized by other countries as a producer of good, skilled, and excellent dairy farmers. Furthermore, Mr. Razo aims the City of General Santos to be the country's next milk capital who can produce quality milk to the people.
            With his perseverance he manage to put a branch in Saskatchewan, Canada.
